# microham

Virtual amateur radio for Disobey 2020 badge.

## Development

- Dev env setup: <https://lemariva.com/blog/2019/08/micropython-vsc-ide-intellisense>
- Directory structure is intentional for IDE & badge integration purposes. The `src/apps/microham` directory contains all the actual application code.
- You probably need to edit the `pymakr.conf` - check which address your badge is available at.
